    Warframe drops you into a far‑future solar system where ancient warriors called Tenno awaken from centuries of sleep and find themselves in the middle of a sprawling interplanetary conflict. You play as one of these Tenno, piloting biomechanical suits known as Warframes—each with its own unique abilities, combat style, and personality. The game blends fast, acrobatic movement with cooperative missions, deep customization, and an ever‑expanding storyline that mixes sci‑fi mystery, space‑opera drama, and stylish action. It's a world built to evolve, constantly adding new quests, characters, and planets to explore.
